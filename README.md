# Multi-Class Classification with Perceptrons and Logistic Regression

## Project Tasks

Task 1: Multi-Class Classification with Perceptrons

  • Perceptrons are used as binary classifiers to perform multi-class classification.

  • Each class in the dataset is treated as a separate binary classification problem.
  
  • The collective outputs of these Perceptrons are then combined to determine the final predicted class.

Task 2: Multi-Class Classification with Logistic Regression

  • Similar to perceptrons, Logistic Regression is utilized as binary classifiers for multi-class classification.

  • Each class is treated as a binary classification problem, and the results are combined to make predictions.
